# All The Ways to Import Images in Gatsby
> A guide for importing images in your Gatsby project.

## Using Gatsby Image
For this method, you will have to import every image one-by-one, however, your images will be processed and optimized for the best performance.

First, install `gatsby-image`, `gatsby-transformer-sharp` and `gatsby-plugin-sharp` using the command:

```sh
yarn add gatsby-image gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-plugin-sharp
```

And add them to the `plugins` array in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`, 
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    ... // your others plugins
  ]
}
```

Also, don't forget to add your images
