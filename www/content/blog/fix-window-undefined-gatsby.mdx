# How to Fix Window Is Not Defined in Gatsby

> A quick fix for window is not defined in GatsbyJS

The error `window is not defined` when running `gatsby build` results from trying to access `window` on the server, where it is not defined. To solve this, you can check for whether it defined or not before using it or importing a module that does.

```js
const isBrowser = typeof window !== `undefined`
```

Now, you can use `isBrowser` when using `window`. For example,

```js
if (isBrowser) {
	console.log(window.location.pathname)
}
```

Or, if you want to import a module (`wow.js` for example),

```js
if (isBrowser) {
	const WOW = require("wow.js")
}
```

Finally, you can also configure Webpack to ignore the module during server rendering by adding the following code in `gatsby-node.js` file.

```js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, loaders, actions }) => {
	if (stage === "build-html") {
		actions.setWebpackConfig({
			module: {
				rules: [
					{
						test: /moduleName/,
						use: loaders.null(),
					},
				],
			},
		})
	}
}
```
