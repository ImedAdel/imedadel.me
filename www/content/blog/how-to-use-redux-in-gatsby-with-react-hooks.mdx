# How to use Redux in Gatsby with React Hooks

A guide to installing, configuring, and using Redux in Gatsby with React Hooks

As the state of your Gatsby app gets more complex and as you need to persist it during page changes, React's `useState` or `useContext` starts becoming less adequate. This is when Redux comes into play.

## Installing Redux

For npm, run

```sh
npm install --save redux react-redux
```

For yarn, run

```sh
yarn add redux react-redux
```

## Configuring Redux in Gatsby

In order to access Redux's store in a React app, you can wrap it with a `Provider` component from `react-redux`. To do that in Gatsby, you have to export a `wrapRootElement` from `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js`.

To avoid repeating yourself, you can create a `.js` file and assign it to `wrapRootElement` in `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js`. We'll name it `wrap-with-provider`.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux"
import { Provider } from "react-redux"

import * as reducers from "./src/redux/reducers"

const initialState = {
	setCount: 0,
	setTotal: 0,
}

const combinedReducers = combineReducers({ ...reducers })
export default ({ element }) => {
	const store = createStore(combinedReducers, initialState)
	return <Provider store={store}>{element}</Provider>
}
```

A couple of notes here:

- `./src/redux/reducers` has an `index.js` file that exports all reducers. That's why we are using the notation `import * as`.
- `combineReducers` is used to combine all the reducer function that we are importing.
- `initialState` is not obligatory, but it depends on your needs. If you will select a certain element from the store when your app mounts, then you need to specify an initial value for the element.
- Elements of your store will have the reducer function name. To change that, you can combine your reducers using
  `jsx Ã· const combinedReducers = combineReducers({ count: reducers.setCount, total: reducers.setTotal, })`

Then, in both your `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js` files, add the following code

```js
import wrapWithProvider from "./wrap-with-provider"
export const wrapRootElement = wrapWithProvider
```

Now, you're ready to go ðŸŽ‰

## How to use Redux Hooks API

Thankfully, Redux supports React's Hooks, which makes development way easier. The two most important Hooks to know are `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

### Extract data from the Redux store state with `useSelector`

The `useSelector` hook accepts two arguments, a `selector` function and an `equalityFn` function.

For instance, for extracting `count` from the state, you can run

```js
const currentCount = useSelector(state => state.count)
```

If your data can be updated, that is, you will be using `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`, it seems that the recommendation is to put `useSelector` _inside_ of `useEffect` (or `useLayoutEffect`).

### Dispatch actions and update the store's data

For this, we've got `useDispatch`, it returns a reference to the `dispatch` function from the Redux store.

First, assign it to a variable, `dispatch` for example, and then use it in events.

```js
import React from "react"
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux"

const MyComponent = () => {
	const dispatch = useDispatch()
	return (
		<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>Increment</button>
	)
}

export default MyComponent
```

By the way, you can also use it inside `useEffect` through a self-invoking function:

```jsx
// ...
React.useEffect(() => {
	;(() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" }))()
})
// ...
```

### About reducers and actions

If this is your first time using Redux, there is a [good article by Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/redux/) about reducers, actions, and data flow in Redux.

But, in a nutshell, reducers get passed the current state and an action type, and they return what the new state is (without modifying the original one).

A cute little reducer can look like this,

```js
const setCount = (state = 0, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case `UPDATE`:
			return action.count

		default:
			return state
	}
}
```

Actions can be organized in a folder together, but that's not necessary. They can look like this

```js
export const setCount = count => ({
	type: `UPDATE`, // type is necessary

	count,
})
```
